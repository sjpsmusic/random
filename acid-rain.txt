C        E           Am
  Acid rain on my shoulders
C               E     
  It burns and stains my clothes
      F               C
  But I don't care at all
               B7    Em
  Now that I'm going home
             B7    Em
  I said I'm going home
  
Em G Em B7 B7 x4

The air, at last, is getting colder
But the acid rain, it seems, wont help my case at all
At least I'm going home
I said I'm going home

Em G Em B7 B7 x4

Many a days I have pondered
To find my rest upon the bedrock that I love
The one I left behind
To whom I shall return

For years I took it all for granted
Took more than I ought to have, but I shall rise above
And give all that I can
For the ones that I love
